# rejseplanen-logger
Save rail journeys made in DK. Intended to create files with info thag can be inputted into RailMiles.me

# Plans/ToDo
- Save to CSV file(s?) that get/s updated
- Could save array to browser local storage. Option to push/pull from "cloud" (file kept on server)
- Nicer single-page UI (see notebook)
- Calculate approx distance using lat/lons (between each stop) - disclaimer note

# Not Possible?
- Posting straight to RailMiles - csrf, need to get auth token/cookie. Maybe middleman here?
