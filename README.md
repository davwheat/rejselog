# Rejselog - Danish Rail Journey Logger

Log rail journeys made in Denmark. Intended to save info that can be inputted into RailMiles.me.

Please excuse the poor code quality, this is a project only intended for my own use and I am by no means a professional. I'm very happy with the [art of the bodge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIFE7h3m40U)!

This repo is for the frontend, which does everything it needs to. Can save to localStorage and everything!  
The backend repo (basic saving/loading to a DB) is at [itsmeimtom/rejselog-backend](https://github.com/itsmeimtom/rejselog-backend);
